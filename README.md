# Webpack Starter for TailwindCSS & Nunjucks

My basic webpack starter for new projects and quick prototyping

(I've included Nunjucks only to have some basic templating functionality within prototypes but usually throw it out for real-world projects that usually run on different template engines).

Use at own risk, I'm not a Webpack expert.
